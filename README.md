# Problem Set 6

**Due 11:59pm PT 11/08**

## (Optional) Reading

As before, the reading is from the [_Think Python_ textbook](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf):

- Chapter 18

Take notes from these readings and submit them as part of this pset. If you opt to do this, you may submit them as a separate file `ps6_notes.txt`/`ps6_notes.md` or you may add them directly to this README file. (files that end in `.md` look best when written in [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))

## Programming

0.  **Understanding Inheritance**
    This is a paper and pencil exercise—please edit this file at the indicated locations with your answers.

    Consider the following code:

    ```python
    class Spell(object):
        def __init__(self, incantation, name):
            self.name = name
            self.incantation = incantation

        def __str__(self):
            return self.name + ' ' + self.incantation + '\n' + self.get_description()

        def get_description(self):
            return 'No description'

        def execute(self):
            print(self.incantation)

    class Accio(Spell):
        def __init__(self):
            Spell.__init__(self, 'Accio', 'Summoning Charm')

    class Confundo(Spell):
        def __init__(self):
            Spell.__init__(self, 'Confundo', 'Confundus Charm')

        def get_description(self):
            return 'Causes the victim to become confused and befuddled.'

    def study_spell(spell):
        print(spell)

    spell = Accio()
    spell.execute()
    study_spell(spell)
    study_spell(Confundo())
    ```

    1. What are the parent and child classes here?

       ````
       Replace this section with your answer. For best results, preserve the
       indentation and stay between the ``` delimiters.
       ````

    2. What does the code print out? (Try figuring it out without running it in Python.) Please mention which lines of code are printing which lines of output.

       ````
       Replace this section with your answer. For best results, preserve the
       indentation and stay between the ``` delimiters.
       ````

    3. Which `get_description` method is called when `study_spell(Confundo())` is executed? Why?

       ````
       Replace this section with your answer. For best results, preserve the
       indentation and stay between the ``` delimiters.
       ````

    4. What do we need to do so that `print Accio()` will print the appropriate description (`This charm summons an object to the caster, potentially over a significant distance`)? Write down the code that we need to add and/or change.

       ````
       Replace this section with your answer. For best results, preserve the
       indentation and stay between the ``` delimiters.

1.  **High Roller** - `highroller.py`

        You’ve become really good at video games but have started wondering what games were like before Pong. Did people play games on the... command line? What was it like to play a game just with text? You decide to try writing such a game in Python, complete with old-fashioned text menus containing numbered options. And what a great idea this is!

    1. **Complete the Die class:** Take a look at the `Die` class and complete it. This class represents a single die, with an immutable number of sides (at least 4) and a mutable current value (between 1 and the number of sides). Implement the following methods:
       ```
        __init__()            // Constructor for a die with the given number of sides
        roll()                // Returns a value as a result of randomly rolling this die
        get_current_value()     // Returns the current value of this die which resulted from the last roll
        get_number_sides()   // Gets the number of sides
        __str__ ()       // Returns a String representation of the value of this die, e.g., “[5]”
       ```

    2.  **Complete the DiceSet class:** Next, make a class called DiceSet, a collection of at least two Die objects, all with the same number
        of sides. You are not allowed to add or remove die objects from a DiceSet once constructed. But you are allowed to roll the dice in the set. Complete the following methods:

        ```
        __init__()          // Constructor
        get_total()          // Returns the current total of this set of dice
        get_descriptor()     // "5d20” for a set with 5 dice of 20 sides each
        roll_all()           // Randomly rolls all of the dice in this set, then returns the new total
        roll_die()           // Randomly rolls the die at index i, returning its new value
        get_current_values()  // Returns the values of all the dice as a List of integers
        matches()           // (optional) `true` if both dice sets are effectively the same: same number of dice, same die size, and same current values—in any order
        __str__()           // Returns a String representation of this set of dice, e.g., “[3][9][12][4]”
        ```

    3.  **Complete the HighRollerGame class:** This class serves as the shell for a console/terminal-based application run from the command line. The player will be repeatedly prompted to enter commands, which the program will carry out. The commands to support are:

        ```
        * h or help : Print a help message, showing all the commands and what they do.
        * (optional) q or quit: Quits the program, but prints a nice message before just before quitting.
        * use <s> <n> : Obtain a new set of dice. Here <n> is the number of dice, and <s> is the number of sides for each die in the set. Prints the descriptor of dice set just obtained and the dice set too.
        * roll all: Rolls all the dice, then prints the dice set.
        * roll <i>: Rolls the i-th die in the set, then prints the dice set.
        * (optional) high or highest: Prints the highest roll so far.
        ```

Note that not every method from the Die and DiceSet class is necessarily used in HighRollerGame. That’s perfectly fine. When you write classes like Die and DiceSet, you want them to be used widely by many people, not just by you. Imagine that you can use these same classes for a role-playing game, for instance, or perhaps traditional dice games like craps (uhhh, when you’re old enough to play that).

Be sure to also implement default behavior for unknown commands by printing an "invalid command" message.

### Testing Your Code

A set of unit tests for `highroller.py` is provided for you in `highroller_test.py`! You can run these during development and before submitting to ensure that your code is working as expected.

To run unit tests:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the repository folder.
2. Run `pip install -U pytest` to install the `pytest` package.
3. Run `python -m pytest` to run all tests!

## What to turn in

1. Submit the electronic copy of any files that you created/modified on your clone. In the Terminal (within your repository clone folder), type these commands. Note that you may repeat these add-commit-push sequences as frequently as you like, based on your progress:

   ```bash
   git add README.md            # For written/image answers to questions.
   git add ps6_notes.md         # If submitting reading notes as a separate file.
   git add highroller.py
   git commit -m "adding files for ps6" # Ideally, personalize this!
   git push
   # By all means, feel free to add/commit/push multiple times before the due date.
   ```

2. Edit this _README.md_ file to include your answers to the following questions:
